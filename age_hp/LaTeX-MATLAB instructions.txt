%Set figure size: [x-position y-position width height (variable)]
set(1, 'units', 'centimeters', 'pos', [0 0 15 10])
Note that x-position and y-position don't really matter -- they define...
where the figure will appear on your screen, relative to the bottom left corner.

figure(figNum)
% plot(somestuff);  
pos = get(figNum,'Position');
set(figNum,'PaperPositionMode','Auto','PaperUnits','centimeters',...
'PaperSize',[pos(3), pos(4)])
print(figNum,'myfigure','-dpdf','-r0')

%If you've got multiple plots make sure to set a unique value for ...
%myfigure so they don't all overwrite each other.

When you insert the figure, you can adjust it a bit using factors of \textwidth:
\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \captionsetup{skip=0.5\baselineskip,size=footnotesize}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.1\textwidth]{Figures/myfigure}
    \caption{This is the caption text}
    \label{fig:myfigure}
\end{figure}

Since you're using a pdf, a bit of stretching up or down won't make ...
a difference in quality, so I usually just play with this a bit until it looks right.
